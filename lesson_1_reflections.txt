just learnt how to compare 
different versions of a file 
using windows command prompt 
and FC command.
Diff -u is used in a 
linux environment
it is easier to find bugs
understand how the code was written
make corrections
manual - logical commits
automatic- too many versions
automatic - good if you do not commit often
saving multiple files at the sametime alloows
us to get a snapshot view
git log is used to get a log of all the commits
git diff is used to understand th difference in 2 commits
git checkout allows us to go back to a previous version of the file
